# Bienvenue sur mon GitHub!

## 👋 Hi, I'm Jaures Azandossessi!

📚 I am currently a student at Epitech Nantes, pursuing a three-year professional track in Systems and Networks Architecture / Software Architecture.

🔥 **Passionate About Programming**: I have worked with many programming languages. My favorites include:
- **C++**: For its unique approach to object-oriented programming
- **Java**, **C#**, **Ruby**, **TypeScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**

🌐 Recently, I worked on a school project involving full-stack development with:
- **Backend**: Predominantly C# leveraging the encapsulation principles and tools provided by ASP.NET Core.
- This project was focused on creating a job board, which involved managing user data for both candidates and recruiters, data management, saving, and password hashing.

🚀 **Looking Forward**: I am excited about where I am right now and am looking forward to continuously improving and reaching the top of my form. I greatly enjoy self-directed learning; it's challenging and truly enhances your learning experience.
